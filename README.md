# YOLOv11-FaceAnonymization
 YOLOv11-FaceAnonymization is a Python-based video processing tool that combines YOLOv11 for real-time object detection with MTCNN for precise face detection and blurring. The project aims to enhance privacy in videos by automatically detecting and blurring faces within the frame, while maintaining the integrity of other visual elements.
